# PokéAPI Multi-Framework Lab

Testing and comparing different web frameworks by building the same app with each one, using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Frameworks

- Next.js
- Nuxt
- SvelteKit
- TanStack Start

## Setup

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## What I want to compare

- Performance and bundle sizes
- Developer experience
- How each framework handles SSR
- Build times
